  *Notice*

  !1.This script will restore all the worlds together. 

  Ex. you have made a backup, then you build the tower in the world #1 and blew yourself up in the world #2,
  you want to restore world #2 but world #1 also get restored and your tower disappears. 

  To restore one specified world you need to enter your world name.

  !2.It will work only if you didn't move any directory (folder) of Scrap Mechanic, and Steam in general.
